 ![sql.png](sql.png)

## Background
This dataset consists of employee data of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. 

The six csv files I imported include: 
-Employee Table
-Department
-Department manager
-Titles
-Salaries
-Department Employees 

I then imported each of these files into their own Postgres SQL table and queried the database to answer questions.
